Computer System Architecture Practicals as per DU guidelines


(Use Simulator â€“ CPU Sim 3.6.9 or any higher version for the implementation)
1. Create a machine based on the following architecture :

Registers
IR DR AC AR PC I E
0 15 0 15 0 15 0 11 0 11 1 bit 1 Bit

Refer to Chapter-5 of reference 1 for description of instructions.
Design the register set, memory and the instruction set. Use this machine for the assignments
of this section.

2. Create a Fetch routine of the instruction cycle.

3. Write an assembly program to simulate ADD operation on two user-entered numbers.

4. Write an assembly program to simulate SUBTRACT operation on two user-entered
numbers.

5. Write an assembly program to simulate the following logical operations on two userentered
numbers.
      1. AND
      2. OR
      3. NOT
      4. XOR
      5. NOR
      6. NAND

6. Write an assembly program to simulate MULTIPLY operation on two user-entered
numbers.

7. Write an assembly program for simulating following memory-reference instructions.
      1. ADD
      2. LDA
      3. STA
      4. BUN
      5. ISZ

8. Write an assembly language program to simulate the machine for following register
reference instructions and determine the contents of AC, E, PC, AR and IR registers in
decimal after the execution:
      1. CLA
      2. CMA
      3. CME
      4. HLT

9. Write an assembly language program to simulate the machine for following register
reference instructions and determine the contents of AC, E, PC, AR and IR registers in
decimal after the execution:
      1. INC
      2. SPA
      3. SNA
      4. SZE

10. Write an assembly language program to simulate the machine for following register
reference instructions and determine the contents of AC, E, PC, AR and IR registers in
decimal after the execution:
      1. CIR
      2. CIL

11. Write an assembly program that reads in integers and adds them together; until a negative
non-zero number is read in. Then it outputs the sum (not including the last number).

12. Write an assembly program that reads in integers and adds them together; until zero is
read in. Then it outputs the sum.

13. Create a machine for the following instruction format:
The instruction format contains a 3-bit opcode, a 1-bit addressing mode and a 12-bit address.
Write an assembly program to simulate the machine for addition of two numbers with I= 0
(Direct Address) and address part = 082. The instruction to be stored at address 022 in RAM,
initialize the memory word with any decimal value at address 082. Determine the contents of
AC, DR, PC, AR and IR in decimal after the execution.

14. Simulate the machine for the memory-reference instruction referred in above question
with I= 1 (Indirect Address) and address part = 082. The instruction to be stored at
address 026 in RAM. Initialize the memory word at address 082 with the value 298.
Initialize the memory word at address 298 with operand 632 and AC with 937. Determine
the contents of AC, DR, PC, AR and IR in decimal after the execution.

15. The instruction format contains 3 bits of opcode, 12 bits for address and 1 bit for
addressing mode. There are only two addressing modes, I = 0 is direct addressing and I =
1 is indirect addressing. Write an assembly program to check the I bit to determine the
addressing mode and then jump accordingly.
